# Customer Churn Analysis in Telecom Industry

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
## Aim of the Project
The aim of the this project is to leverage Python for data processing, analysis, and modeling, coupled with Power BI for visualization, to develop a comprehensive solution for identifying and understanding factors influencing customer churn in the telecom sector.
## Understanding Churn in Telecom Industry
There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - **postpaid** (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) and **prepaid** (customers pay/recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services). In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn. However, in the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily (e.g. someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and then intend to resume using the services again). 

Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical (and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the term *‘churn’* should be defined carefully. Also, prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe in North America.
## Project Implementation
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

Gather relevant data sources, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and historical churn data. 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential factors influencing customer churn.

Visualize key metrics using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to facilitate a better understanding of the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:**

Identify and create relevant features that may contribute to predicting customer churn.

4. **Integration with PowerBI:**

Export model predictions and relevant data from Python to Power BI.
Design interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize churn trends, customer segments, and the impact of various factors on churn.
